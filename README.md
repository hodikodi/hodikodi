Iâ€™m a Python and IoT engineer with a cross-disciplinary background in architecture and digital twins. What sets me apart is my ability to bridge gaps between teams â€” translating technical challenges into workflows that balance the needs of engineers, compliance teams, and decision-makers. I thrive on learning new technical skills quickly, but I also pay close attention to peopleâ€™s wellbeing and communication across levels. In past roles, this has helped me deliver production-grade IoT deployments that achieved measurable energy savings, while keeping teams engaged and aligned.
